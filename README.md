Duo Security two-factor authentication for Go web applications. It uses [Duo](https://duo.com)'s official JavaScript widget in an iframe, and a high-level API to authenticate users with Duoâ€™s 2FA.

## Requirements

In order to use this you must have a [Duo account](https://signup.duo.com/) and create a new application in your account. You will then be given keys to use for authentication.

## Demo app

There is a functional [demo app in this repository](demo/README.md).
